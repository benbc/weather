# Plan for development

## Tasks

- [x] Add new (Haskell) version to workflow
- [x] Check that the workflow runs successfully
- [x] Local change to `/docs/` show up as a diff even though it's ignored -- do we need to rethink?
- [x] Change from `/docs/` to `/out/` for output directory
- [ ] New version of `just deploy` that works at the top level and does a better job of checking success
- [ ] Add last update time to Haskell page
